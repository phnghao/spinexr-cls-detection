# Detection of Spinal Lesions in X-ray Images Using a Combined Classification and Detection Approach

## Problem

multiple types of spinal lesions.

- **Input:** A single spinal X-ray image.
- **Output:** A set of detected lesions, each represented by a bounding box, a lesion label,
  and a confidence score.
